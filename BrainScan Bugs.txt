Currently using my old colortool as a template. Planning on expanding the 2d texture window to the entire canvas and hijacking the data stream.

Need to figure out how the rendering for the brain part works and hijack it.
Leads? 
From what I remember it loads the texture as soon as the file is loaded. Try removing the current file to see if it causes an error then trace the error.
