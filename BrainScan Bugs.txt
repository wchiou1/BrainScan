Using hashlife renderer to render the brain. Need to find where the parser is for this thing.

The key is fill_square.
Seems the offset isn't working right... fix it.[DONE]

Check if the brain is supposed to have holes, check other nifti files.[FIXED]

We need a way to find if a part exists on a 2d coordinate.
Iterate through all the coordinates, keep the i and j coordinate constant.
Have a buffer array, for each element which is different, push it to the array.
Store the array in the coresponding i and j coordinate on this new ndarray.

Filtered brain regions by point is fully functional. Next step is to average out the location of all the brain regions and create buttons in those locations.
